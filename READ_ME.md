Practice making a Restful API to interface a user with simple string processing functions.

#Description
Software Testing Functions are located in the 'Testing the functions' python notebook

api.py holds the restful api build with flask_restful. 

Structure for the API is based on these examples.
1. blog.miquelgrinberg.com/post/desgining-a-restful-api-using-flask-restful
2. Flask_restful full example from the documentation.

# Installation
To run these files please install the requirements.txt with the following command in the folder where requirements.txt is located

```shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
Let me know if you have any feedback.

#Functions
pick_rnd: returns a random word from a list of input words
rhyme: returns a list of words that rhyme with the input word
encode/decode: allow you to encrypt/decrypt an input string using a simple caeser cipher.

Thanks for checking out my practice.
